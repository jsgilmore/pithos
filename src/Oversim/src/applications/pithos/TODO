PhD TODO list:

Major:
Investigate why per group peer arrivals are SO much higher than per group peer departures
Remove unused stats vectors from simulation
Read papers that cite replication paper, to see whether any has expanded on the Markov chain in a similar way to I did.
Determine distributions of object requests and peer lifetimes to be used in PithosTestApp

Implment Pithos as a real world application
Develop grouping algorithm based on player traces
Have Pithos construct groups based on the grouping algorithm
Write-up PhD

Minor:
Implement object modification for group storage.
Extend the pithos test application to add modify testing.
Test the system for various numbers of malicious peers

Make the latitude and longitude ranges for peers and super peers a changeable paramter instead of 100
Support can be added for partially connected groups that will reduce network bandwidth at the cost of latency
Add a debug mode to the code, which ads the debugging code currently present in Pithos as an option and not always.
The error condition of an unspecified peer should be logged.
Group storage should record its own successes, failures and latencies and not depend on PithosTestApp from recording them indirectly.
The DHT module can be changed so as to store and retrieve GameObjects instead of BinaryValues
A maximum distance needs to be defined for the directory server
Ensure correctness for pithos under 32bit systems. This includes testing long variable sizes and making them 32bit safe.
