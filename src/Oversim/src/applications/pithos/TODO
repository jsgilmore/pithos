PhD TODO list:

Pithos:
Major:
Implement object modification for group storage.
Intuitivly, many more updates will occur, compared to puts, which strengthens the case for implementing update.
Extend the pithos test application to add modify testing.
Determine distributions of object requests and peer lifetimes to be used in PithosTestApp
Distributions for put, get and update will probably vary greatly.
These distributions have to be translated into their C/S counterparts, to enable profiling.

Ensure sent get stats in Pithos test app, match the stats in Group storage. This can probably be fixed by recording the number of unhandled requests.

Implement Pithos as a real world application
Develop grouping algorithm based on player traces
Have Pithos construct groups based on the grouping algorithm

Minor:
Make the latitude and longitude ranges for peers and super peers a changeable paramter instead of 100
Support can be added for partially connected groups that will reduce network bandwidth at the cost of latency
Add a debug mode to the code, which ads the debugging code currently present in Pithos as an option and not always.
The error condition of an unspecified peer should be logged.
Group storage should record its own successes, failures and latencies and not depend on PithosTestApp from recording them indirectly.
The DHT module can be changed so as to store and retrieve GameObjects instead of BinaryValues
A maximum distance needs to be defined for the directory server
Ensure correctness for pithos under 32bit systems. This includes testing long variable sizes and making them 32bit safe.

Dissertation:
Add a discussion of how Pithos attempts to address both state management and persistency.
Make sure the state management and persistency chapter uses the terms state management and persistency correctly.
Remove the term "game" where it is not required and replace with environment and VE.
Replace "player" with "user".
Add bandwidth (overhead) as a required metric of a storage system.
Ensure that all applicable experimental setup parameters are given in the relevant evaluation sections.
Complete theoretical section, which derives expected values for all the relevant Pithos metrics.
Conclude
Add discussion of how Pithos satisfies both state management and state persistency

Introduction:
Read the PhD on P2P Second life.
Complete related section by adding discussion on P2P Second Life.
A discussion of the PhD by Fan can also be be added, since it formed the basis of this work.

Storage:
Add discussion of P2P Second Life to overlay storage.

Modelling:
Add sections back into the chapter that were removed when the paper was shortened.
Add more results, comparing variations in more parameters.

Ensure all symbols and abbreviations are present.

Conclusion:
