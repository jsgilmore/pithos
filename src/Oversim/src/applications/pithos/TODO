PhD TODO list:

Upgrade to Omnet++ 4.2

Major:
Implement time to live for group storage.
Expand the pithos churn mechanism for group storage to allow for migration between groups and not just leaving and joining of groups.
Develop grouping algorithm based on player traces
Have Pithos construct groups based on the grouping algorithm
Test the system for various levels of churn and various numbers of replicas
Write-up PhD

Change the numSent variables to be the actual recorded numbers and not magic numbers of the known variables.

Minor:
The correct packet sizes for DHT storage still have to be implemented. The current implementation uses the data in the packet and not the specified size of the packet.
Implement object update for group storage.
Extend the pithos test application to add modify testing.
Reduce the number of overlay get failures under no churn
Test the system for various numbers of malicious peers

Make the latitude and longitude ranges for peers and super peers a changeable paramter instead of 100
Support can be added for partially connected groups that will reduce network bandwidth at the cost of latency
Add a debug mode to the code, which ads the debugging code currently present in Pithos as an option and not always.
The error condition of an unspecified peer should be logged.
Group storage should record its own successes, failures and latencies and not depend on PithosTestApp from recording them indirectly.
Get retry mechanisms can be added to improve group get reliabiltiy at the cost of latency (if done sequentially) or bandwidth (if done in parallel).
The DHT module can be changed so as to store and retrieve GameObjects instead of BinaryValues
A maximum distance needs to be defined for the directory server
Ensure correctness for pithos under 32bit systems. This includes testing long variable sizes and making then 32bit safe.
