PhD TODO list:

Pithos:
Major:
Implement object modification for group storage.
Intuitivly, many more updates will occur, compared to puts, which strengthens the case for implementing update.
Extend the pithos test application to add modify testing.
Determine distributions of object requests and peer lifetimes to be used in PithosTestApp
Distributions for put, get and update will probably vary greatly.
These distributions have to be translated into their C/S counterparts, to enable profiling.

Implement Pithos as a real world application
Develop grouping algorithm based on player traces
Have Pithos construct groups based on the grouping algorithm

Minor:
Make the latitude and longitude ranges for peers and super peers a changeable paramter instead of 100
Support can be added for partially connected groups that will reduce network bandwidth at the cost of latency
Add a debug mode to the code, which ads the debugging code currently present in Pithos as an option and not always.
The error condition of an unspecified peer should be logged.
Group storage should record its own successes, failures and latencies and not depend on PithosTestApp from recording them indirectly.
The DHT module can be changed so as to store and retrieve GameObjects instead of BinaryValues
A maximum distance needs to be defined for the directory server
Ensure correctness for pithos under 32bit systems. This includes testing long variable sizes and making them 32bit safe.

Dissertation:
Make sure the dissertation never talks about "this paper".
Make sure the state management and persistency chapter uses the terms state management and persistency correctly.
Remove the term "game" where it is not required and replace with environment and VE.
Replance "player" with "user".
In the introduction, talk about MMVEs, and what applications they can be. Then name MMOGs as exmample of MMVEs.

Make sure all introductions are relevant.
Make sure all conclusions are relevant.
Complete the Pithos design Chapter (Show design results, for example group consistency)
Complete the results Chapter where only Pithos results are shown and compared to other such systems.
Complete theoretical section, which derives expected values for all the relevant Pithos metrics.
Complete the chapter that compares theoretical results with the actual Pithos results.
Conclude
