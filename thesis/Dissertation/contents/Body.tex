    \subsection{Bandwidth requirements (overhead)}
    %Mention something about low bandwidth links and how that influences timeout and what extra mechanisms were required.
    %Check how this increases with increased network sizes and varying levels of network churn.

        \subsection{Group consistency}
        %Check how this increases with increased network sizes and varying levels of network churn.
